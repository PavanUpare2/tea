    <h1>About Tea Time</h1>
	<h1>this is the heading section</h1>
    <p><strong>Tea Time</strong> was founded with a simple idea: to bring people together through the warmth of tea. We believe that every cup tells a story — of tradition, health, and connection.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To share the joy of tea with the world by offering high-quality blends, promoting sustainable farming, and encouraging mindful moments.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>It started with a cup of green tea in a small kitchen. That cup sparked a journey through the hills of Darjeeling, the markets of Kyoto, and the farms of Sri Lanka. Each destination added a layer of knowledge and flavor to what would become Tea Time.</p>

    <h2>Why Tea?</h2>
    <p>Tea is more than just a drink — it's a ritual, a tradition, and a source of wellness. From calming chamomile to energizing matcha, we celebrate the diversity and richness of tea culture.</p>
